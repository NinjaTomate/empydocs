.. _Yahweh:

Yahweh
======

Yahweh is the user administration console for Empyrean. Use it to manage
users and user policy. It includes an interface for Yahweh user
management as well so you can give access to other users requiring
management capability.

.. _`Yahweh first time setup`:

First time setup
----------------

1. Navigate to Yahweh and login with the default password

   |Login screen|

.. NOTE::
   | Username: ``admin``
   | Password: ``password``

2. Select the Yahweh accounts console

   |Yahweh accounts|

   |Yahweh accounts cont|

3. Edit the admin account and set your new password in the password
   field

   |Yahweh edit|
   |Yahweh password|

.. NOTE::
   When creating users, users without the ``Yahweh administrators``
   role will not be able to see or edit Yahweh accounts.

Now to set up some accounts!

4. Navigate to the Empyrean accounts console

   |Empyrean accounts|

   |Empyrean accounts cont|

5. Create a new user

   |Empyrean create|

   |Empyrean details|

.. NOTE::
   The "allowed mimetypes" section of the form allows you to restrict
   what mimetypes this user can upload by specifying a whitelist of
   allowed mimetypes. In most situations this can be left untouched.
   Tags are a WIP feature, so to accomodate for future schema changes
   its best to leave this blank as well.

   Its also worth noting that the enabled field has since been
   replaced with an "allow logins" field.

6. And there we have it, a brand new account ready to go!

   |Empyrean new account|

   Your new user can now log in through his or her client of choosing
   to change their password, upload files etc.

7. Finally, don't forget to logout via the home page
